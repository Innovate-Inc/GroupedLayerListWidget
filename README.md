# Grouped LayerList Widget
The Grouped Layerlist widget is a widget for utilization within Esri's Web Application Builder for Developers. This widget provides a layerlist that is organized by custom themes. When the Grouped Layerlist widget is configured in the Web Application Builder for Developer themes or groups can be created and layers within the web map associated with the application can be grouped into those themes. Each layer within a theme has  potential options for changing the layer transparency, enable/disable popups, change layer symbology, view attribute table, and showing item details depending on the layer type.
