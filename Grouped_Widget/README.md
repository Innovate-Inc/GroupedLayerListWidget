# GRP Widget

The Geographic Response Plan (GRP) Widget is a custom JavaScript widget developed for US EPA Region 9 used to compile and display a series GRP tables. GRPs provide guidance for effectively deploying containment and recovery equipment in the event of a spill to navigable waterways. The GRP Widget reads a feature service containing up to 30 related tables of GRP information for a given point and allows users to quickly and easily scroll through response content, including toggling layers on and off for a variety of related booming techniques based on environment conditions.
